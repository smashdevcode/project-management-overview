# Task Management

# Define Your Project

* What's the vision for your app?
* What's the problem that its trying to solve?

# Find the Core

* Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
* Include your project requirements
* Build half an app, not a half-assed app

---

# Tasks

* Create a list of tasks to build your core app
* Breakdown your features into small tasks
* Less than 4 or 8 hours of effort per task

---

# Parallel Development

* Vertical slices - By feature
* Horizontal slices - Front vs back end
* Look for opportunities to pair programming

# Don't Get Distracted

* It's a problem when it's a problem
* Document new tasks as they are identified
* Move them to the backlog
